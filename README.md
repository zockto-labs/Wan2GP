## 🔥 Latest Updates
### June 11 2025: WanGP v5.5
👋 *Hunyuan Video Custom Audio*: it is similar to Hunyuan Video Avatar except there isn't any lower limit on the number of frames and you can use your reference images in a different context than the image itself\
*Hunyuan Video Custom Edit*: Hunyuan Video Controlnet, use it to do inpainting and replace a person in a video while still keeping his poses. Similar to Vace but less restricted than the Wan models in terms of content...


### June 6 2025: WanGP v5.41
👋 Bonus release: Support for **AccVideo** Lora to speed up x2 Video generations in Wan models. Check the Loras documentation to get the usage instructions of AccVideo.\
You will need to do a *pip install -r requirements.txt*

### June 6 2025: WanGP v5.4
👋 World Exclusive : **Hunyuan Video Avatar** Support ! You won't need 80 GB of VRAM nor 32 GB oF VRAM, just 10 GB of VRAM will be sufficient to generate up to 15s of high quality speech / song driven Video at a high speed with no quality degradation. Support for TeaCache included.\
Here is a link to the original repo where you will find some very interesting documentation and examples. https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanVideo-Avatar. Kudos to the Hunyuan Video Avatar team for the best model of its kind.\
Also many thanks to Reevoy24 for his repackaging / completing the documentation

### May 28 2025: WanGP v5.31
👋 Added **Phantom 14B**, a model that you can use to transfer objects / people in the video. My preference goes to Vace that remains the king of controlnets.
VACE improvements: Better sliding window transitions, image mask support in Matanyone, new Extend Video feature, and enhanced background removal options.
